  <br>Don't Look Back in Anger
  <br>Slip inside the eye of your mind
  <br>Don't you know you might find
  <p>A better place to play?
  You said that you'd never been
  But all the things that you've seen
  They slowly fade away
  So I'll start a revolution from my bed
  Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
  Step outside, summertime's in bloom
  Stand up beside the fireplace
  Take that look from off your face
  You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
  And so, Sally can wait
  She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
  Her soul slides away
  But don't look back in anger
  I heard you say</p>
  <img src="oasis_01.jpg" width="100%">
  <p style="margin-top:50px;">
  Take me to the place where you go
  Where nobody knows if it's night or day
  But please don't put your life in the hands
  Of a Rock 'n' Roll band
  Who'll throw it all away
  I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed
  Cause you said the brains I had went to my head
  Step outside, 'cause summertime's in bloom
  Stand up beside the fireplace
  Take that look from off your face
  Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out
  And so, Sally can wait
  She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
  My soul slides away
  But don't look back in anger
  I heard you say</p>
  So, Sally can wait
  She knows it's too late as we're walking on by
  Her soul slides away
  But don't look back in anger
  I heard you say
  So, Sally can wait
  She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
  My soul slides away
  But don't look back in anger
  Don't look back in anger
  I heard you say
  At least not today
